# The Shield Playground - GSAP Draggable Carousel Horizontal Loop Slider Inertia Demo

## Definition of done's

[Link to prototype (working example in vanillaJS)](https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/gOvvJee)

- The slider is drabbagle & smooth, items don't lag around.

- The code is "reactified" (for example uses `useRef` instead of `querySelectors`)

- There is a state for knowing what the "current" item is. The current item is the one closest to the center of the viewport/screen

## Nice to have's (do this if you're done with the above)

- The slider is from right to left on the x axis

- onMouseEnter, the animation slows down or pauses.

- onMouseLeave, the animation continues
